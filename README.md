# Potato_Disease_Classification

The vegetable Potato is quite familiar to all of us. After crops like rice and wheat, Potato is one of the most cultivated crops in India. But like other crops, Potato is also vulnerable to diseases. The production of Potato gets heavily hampered due to the diseases like Early blight and Late blight. These diseases, if not detected at an early stage, damage the crops, affects the production and apparently results in significant losses.Therefore there is an aim to fasten the disease detection process so as to increase the Potato production by detecting the mentioned diseases at an early stage of Cultivation by using CNN, a Deep Learning based approach. Also, need to diagnose the potato crop by detecting and classifying itâ€™s leaves, whether they are healthy or infected. In this paper, we present a deep learning based approach to discover the particular early and late blight diseases in Potato by capturing the visual aspects of the leaves of many potato crops. We find Image processing the best way to detect and analyze the particular diseases as it helps us to extract the very essential information from the images of the leaves. Using a dataset obtained from subsidiary of plant village dataset, consisting of 3000 samples having 1000 samples each of healthy, early blight and late blight infected leaves, we trained a custom model with some advancements from our end to detect and categorize the leaves into healthy and diseased. The CNN based model gave an accuracy of 99% when prepared over 80% train data. The output we got shows that CNN outperforms all in the field of Potato disease classification.
